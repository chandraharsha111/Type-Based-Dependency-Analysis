# Type-Based-Dependency-Analysis
Developed a type based dependency analyzer which would build a type table by extracting lexical content from source code. Using this type table I have implemented dependency analysis table which would give information about each file and the list of files depending upon it   Traced the Strong Components using Trajanâ€™s Algorithm. A strong component is the largest set of files that are mutually dependent. All the analysis results were stored into a NoSQL DB i.e. implemented by me  Storing the analysis results into NoSQL Data Base would help us persist the analysis results in form of meta data as XML
